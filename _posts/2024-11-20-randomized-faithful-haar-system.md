This is an interactive visualization of the randomized faithful Haar system constructed in my article **Dimension dependence of factorization problems: Haar system Hardy spaces** (_Studia Math._, to appear; [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05187.pdf), see also [arXiv:2407.05187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05187)).

Clicking on the individual Haar functions changes their sign and, if "Full randomization" is checked, updates the subtree below the clicked function. Clicking on "Randomize" flips a randomly chosen Haar function. "Start" initiates an animation, where the system is randomized repeatedly.
