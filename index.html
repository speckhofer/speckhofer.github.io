I am a PhD student in mathematics at Johannes Kepler University Linz. On this website you can find my publications, slides of talks, CV and some posts on topics related to mathematics. My personal projects (in particular, my films) can be found on my other website <a href="https://tspeckhofer.jimdofree.com/">tspeckhofer.jimdofree.com</a>.
