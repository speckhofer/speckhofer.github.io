I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for Algebra at Johannes Kepler University Linz (Austria), under the supervision of Manuel Kauers. Before that, I completed my doctoral studies in mathematics at the Institute of Analysis under the supervision of Richard Lechner and Paul F.X. Müller. On this website you can find my publications, slides of talks, CV and some other content related to mathematics.
