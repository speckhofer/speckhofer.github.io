I am currently a Postdoctoral Visitor at York University, Toronto, under the supervision of Pavlos Motakis. Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for Algebra of Johannes Kepler University Linz, under the supervision of Manuel Kauers. I also completed my doctoral studies in mathematics at JKU Linz, at the Institute of Analysis, under the supervision of Richard Lechner and Paul F.X. Müller. On this website you can find my publications, slides of talks, CV and some other content related to mathematics.
