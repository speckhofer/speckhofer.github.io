I am currently a Postdoctoral Visitor at York University, Toronto, under the supervision of Pavlos Motakis, working in Banach space theory. Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for Algebra of Johannes Kepler University Linz under the supervision of Manuel Kauers. I also completed my doctoral studies in mathematics at JKU Linz, at the Institute of Analysis, under the supervision of Richard Lechner and Paul F.X. MÃ¼ller. On this website you can find my publications, slides of talks, CV and some other content related to mathematics.
